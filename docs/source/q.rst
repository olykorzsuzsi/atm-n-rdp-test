Questions
=========

These are the follow-up questions I would like to ask after finishing this version of the documentation:

- What are the most important features of each RDP version that we would like to emphasise?
- Can a user enable multiple RDP versions? If so, what decides which one will be in use?
- How does RDP 4-style authentication enablement work exactly?
- When would a user need to switch on RDP 4-style authentication? Is it for disabling Network Level Authentication for later versions?
- What does the 'Maximum display depth' feature do exactly? Is it for allowing the users to define the color depth themselves?
- Why do we allow them to set color depth manually? Are there any limitations for each RDP version? Could users run into a connection problem after setting up their preferred number of bits per pixel?
- Could you elaborate more on how this pre-channel check works?
- How does compression work exactly? How does it make the life of the user easier?
- What do we need to take into consideration when setting up the width and height of the remote desktop display? What resolution would cause problems?
- What does the 'Autologon domain suffix' feature do exactly?
- Where will these saved connection configurations be used for?
- What is the purpose of the whole RDP control section? Is it closely related to other features as well? It would be good to know for context.
